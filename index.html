                    <p>
                        Emma and Victoria are recent graduates of Augusta University (Augusta, GA), where they were both NSF scholars and heavily involved in various aspects of both campus life and research opportunities. Both have held leadership roles, organized social and research events, and mentored junior students. Additionally, as best friends and classmates, they have aided each other with their individual research projects and assembled collaborative group projects.

                        Their most recent collaborative project has centered around restoration analyses of man-made transport cut closures on Georgia`s Satilla River. This project compiled 6+ years of data collected before and after the cut closures, including fish assemblage data to analyze with the Shannon Diversity Index and cross-reference with collected salinity, temperature, and depth of water data. A poster presentation detailing their findings was presented at CERF`s Biennial meeting in Richmond, VA, November 9 - 13, 2025.
